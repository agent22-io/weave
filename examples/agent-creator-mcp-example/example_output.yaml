# Example Generated Agent Configuration
# Created using the Agent Creator MCP Server

version: "1.0"

agents:
  research_summarizer:
    # Analyzes research papers and creates concise summaries that highlight
    # key findings, methodology, and conclusions for quick understanding
    model: "claude-3-sonnet"
    tools: [text_length, string_formatter]
    outputs: "paper_summary"
    config:
      temperature: 0.3
      max_tokens: 1500

# This configuration was generated through an interactive Q&A session:
# 1. Agent Name: research_summarizer
# 2. Description: Analyzes research papers and creates concise summaries...
# 3. Model: claude-3-sonnet (balanced performance)
# 4. Tools: text_length, string_formatter (for text processing)
# 5. Temperature: 0.3 (more deterministic/factual)
# 6. Max Tokens: 1500 (medium-length summaries)
# 7. Inputs: None (standalone agent)
# 8. Outputs: paper_summary

# Usage:
#   weave plan                  # Preview execution
#   weave apply --real          # Execute with real LLM

# To extend this into a workflow, you could add more agents:
#
# agents:
#   paper_fetcher:
#     model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
#     tools: [web_search]
#     outputs: "raw_paper"
#
#   research_summarizer:
#     model: "claude-3-sonnet"
#     tools: [text_length, string_formatter]
#     inputs: "paper_fetcher"
#     outputs: "paper_summary"
#     config:
#       temperature: 0.3
#       max_tokens: 1500
#
#   citation_extractor:
#     model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
#     tools: [json_validator]
#     inputs: "research_summarizer"
#     outputs: "citations"
#
# weaves:
#   research_pipeline:
#     description: "Fetch, summarize, and extract citations from papers"
#     agents: [paper_fetcher, research_summarizer, citation_extractor]
