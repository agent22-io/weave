# Memory Example - Agents with short-term and long-term memory

version: "1.0"

agents:
  # Agent with buffer strategy (keeps system message + recent messages)
  chat_assistant:
    model: "gpt-4"
    prompt: "You are a helpful assistant that remembers context from the conversation."
    outputs: "chat_response"
    memory:
      type: "buffer"           # Buffer strategy: keeps system + recent messages
      max_messages: 20         # Keep last 20 messages
      persist: true            # Save long-term memory to .weave/memory/
      context_window: 4000     # Context window size in tokens

  # Agent with sliding window strategy
  data_processor:
    model: "gpt-4"
    prompt: "You process data and maintain recent context."
    inputs: "chat_assistant"
    outputs: "processed_data"
    memory:
      type: "sliding_window"   # Sliding window: keeps only last N messages
      max_messages: 10         # Keep last 10 messages
      persist: false           # Don't save to long-term memory

  # Agent with long-term memory persistence
  knowledge_keeper:
    model: "claude-3-sonnet"
    prompt: |
      You are a knowledge keeper that learns from conversations.
      You maintain long-term memory of important facts and information.
    inputs: "data_processor"
    outputs: "insights"
    memory:
      type: "buffer"
      max_messages: 50
      persist: true            # Long-term memory will be saved to .weave/memory/knowledge_keeper_memory.md
